# PerPlayerRealWorldTime
Spigot plugin for servers running an (equirectangular) Earth map, it allows time synchronization with the real world time, on a per player basis. The approach used is by calculating the sun altitude, meaning itâ€™s also friendly for latitudes far from the equator. This does not alter mob spawning behavior.
Some adjustements need to be done on the Minecraft time conversion level.

## Limitation
- When solar time reaches noon, the sun will teleport from east to west.
